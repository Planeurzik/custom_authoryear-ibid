The apparatus has a sensing element formed as a section of a coupled slow-wave structure including a hollow ceramic tube and at least two impedance conductors each curled into a helix with opposing directions of winding around the tube to form a resonator. The sensing element is connected by coaxial cables to a remote electronics module which includes electronic components to create a resonant circuit with the sensing element. A metal internal target rod is configured to move into and out of the sensing element, being covered and uncovered by portions of the sensing element. This will cause the frequency of the resonant circuit to change proportionally to the movement of the target rod. The length of the coaxial cables separates the electronics module from the sensing element by a distance sufficient to avoid exposing the electronics module to harsh environments.},

This presentation will discuss search engine optimization techniques, especially for Google Scholar, which can be responsible for the majority of referrals that result in {IR} file downloads.

	title = {Logic-based Cognitive Planning : from theory to implementation},
	url = {https://hal.science/tel-04136582},
	abstract = {In this thesis, we introduced a cognitive planning framework that can be used to endow artificial agents with the necessary skills to represent and reason about other agents' mental states. Our cognitive planning framework is based on an {NP}-fragment of an epistemic logic with a semantics exploiting belief bases and whose satisfiability problem can be reduced to {SAT}. We detail the set of translations for the reduction of our fragment to {SAT}. In addition, we provide complexity results for checking satisfiability of formulas in our {NP}-fragment. We define a general architecture for the cognitive planning problem. Afterward, we define two types of planning problem: informative and interrogative, and we find the complexity of finding a solution for the cognitive planning problem in both cases. Furthermore, we illustrated the potential of our framework for applications in human-machine interaction with the help of two examples in which an artificial agent is expected to interact with a human agent through dialogue and to persuade the human to behave in a certain way. Moreover, we introduced a formalization of simple cognitive planning as a quantified boolean formula ({QBF}) with an optimal number of quantifiers in the prefix. The model for cognitive planning was implemented. We describe how to represent and generate the belief base. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the machine performs the reasoning process to find a sequence of speech acts intended to induce a potential intention in the human agent. The implemented system has three main components: belief revision, cognitive planning, and the translator module. These modules work integrated to capture the human agent's beliefs during the human-machine interaction process and generate a sequence of speech acts to achieve a persuasive goal. Finally, we present an epistemic language to represent the beliefs and actions of an artificial player in the context of the board game Yokai. The cooperative game Yokai requires a combination of theory of mind ({ToM}), temporal and spatial reasoning for an artificial agent to play effectively. We show that the language properly accounts for these three dimensions and that its satisfiability problem is {NP}-complete. We implement the game and perform experiments to compare the cooperation level between agents when they try to achieve a common goal by analyzing two scenarios: when the game is played between a human and the artificial agent versus when two humans play the game.},

	doi = {10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-vsmpx-v2},
	abstract = {The ability to identify small molecules in complex samples from their mass spectra is among the grand challenges of analytical chemistry. Improvements to this ability could significantly advance fields as diverse as drug discovery, diagnostics, environmental science, and synthetic biology. A primary bottleneck is that standard structure elucidation technologies are limited to identifying only those molecules that are contained in databases of known spectra or molecular structures and are therefore not well suited to identifying the vast majority of potentially billions of natural metabolites, whose structures are not yet catalogued. To improve the identification of molecular structures within this vast dark chemical space, we present {MS}2Mol, a {\textbackslash}textit\{de novo\} structure prediction model based on a generative sequence to sequence transformer. We also release {EnvedaDark}, a first-of-its-kind for benchmarking identification performance on unknown metabolites. {EnvedaDark} contains experimental mass spectra from 226 natural products not currently found in major databases. We demonstrate on this challenging dataset that {MS}2Mol is able to predict 21{\textbackslash}\% of molecular structures to within a close-match accuracy threshold and 62{\textbackslash}\% to within meaningful similarity, both of which are significant improvements over the closest match retrieved using standard database methods. We further present a confidence scorer that enables practical usage for novel molecule discovery and enriches the accuracy on meaningfully-similar and close-match thresholds to 98{\textbackslash}\% and 63{\textbackslash}\%, respectively, for the top 10{\textbackslash}\% most confident predictions.},
